# Solution of Linear Wave Equation

This repository provides a solution for a one-dimensional linear wave equation: ut+a.ux=0 using different integration schemes. This program aids as a starter for mechanical engineers who are interested in numerical programming. The code is developed using both MATLAB and Python. For Python, classes and objects are used and the OOPs concepts help in writing a compact program. The linear wave equation is solved using the following schemes and solutions are compared.
    
 * First-order Backward Difference Explicit Integration
 * Second-order Backward Difference Explicit Integration
 * Crank-Nicolson, Implicit Integration
 * Lax-Wendroff Explicit Integration
 * Lax Explicit Integration
 * First-order Backward Difference, Implicit Integration
