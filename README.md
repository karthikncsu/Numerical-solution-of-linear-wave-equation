# Solution of Linear Wave Equation

This repository provides a solution for one dimensional linear wave equation: ut+a.ux=0 using different integration schemes. This program aids as a starter for mechanical engineers who are interested about numerical programming. The code is developed using both MATLAB and Python. For Ptyhon, classes and objects are used and the OOPs concepts help in writing a compact program. The solution of the linear wave equation is obtained using the following schemes
    
 * First-order Backward Difference Explicit Integration
 * Second-order Backward Difference Explicit Integration
 * Crank-Nicolson, Implicit Integration
 * Lax-Wendroff Explicit Integration
 * Lax Explicit Integration
 * First-order Backward Difference, Implicit Integration
